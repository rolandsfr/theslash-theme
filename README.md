## Theme itself

You can find the theme in the [/theme](https://github.com/rolandsfr/theslash-theme/tree/main/theme) directory  
A demo is deployed [here](https://theslash.netlify.app/)  
The theme was initially published on February 7th (2020) and later migrated to this repository.
  
## About the project & history
  
The TheSlash theme was initially designed and developed exclusively for ThemeForest. Unfortunately, this theme did not make it to their selling platform.  
TheSlash was designed and developed by one individual (as in me), thus it took ages to prepare it, and, unfortunately, it did not pay off.  
Just make sure you do not start your carrier on ThemeForest as an indie-dev and never resubmit your item for a review with not enough changes (lead to a hard reject after several reviews :/ )
  
## Future plans

The original theme bundle (the one intended for sale) has been lost, thus making me not want to further maintain the project.  
Nevertheless, I may or may not end up doing something with this, since this is a lot of effort put into one single project.
